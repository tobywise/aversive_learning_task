Now you're going to have a chance to practice the task.

On each trial, you will get to choose one of the mine entrances. You will then see the type of rock this took you to.

When you've seen the type of rock, you will find out whether there was a snake hiding in the rocks or not. If there was a snake, you will receive a shock.

For the rocks that don't have snakes hiding in them, you will just find a puddle of water.

One of the types of rock will be more likely to have a snake hiding under it. You should try to choose the mine entrances that will lead you to the safest rock type.
